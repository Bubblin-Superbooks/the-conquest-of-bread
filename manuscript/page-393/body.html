This is, nevertheless, what collectivists are doing when they recommend the use of the <em>labour-cheques</em> as a mode of remuneration for labour accomplished for the great Collectivist employer—the State.</p><p>It is easy to understand why the early English socialists, since the time of Robert Owen, came to the system of labour-cheques. They simply tried to make Capital and Labour agree. They repudiated the idea of laying hands on capitalist property by means of revolutionary measures.</p><p>It is also easy to understand why Proudhon took up later on the same idea. In his Mutualist system he tried to make Capital less offensive, notwithstanding the retaining of private property, which he detested from the bottom of his heart, but which he believed to be necessary to guarantee individuals against the State.</p></div> </div>
