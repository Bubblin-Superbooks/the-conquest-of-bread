<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">what the earth can be made to yield to man when he cultivates it in a reasonable way, instead of throwing seed haphazard in a badly ploughed soil as he mostly does to-day. In the great farms of Western America, some of which cover 30 square miles, but have a poorer soil than the manured soil of civilized countries, only 10 to 15 English bushels per English acre are obtained; that is to say, half the yield of European farms or of American farms in the Eastern States. And  nevertheless, thanks to machines which enable 2 men to plough 4 English acres a day, 100 men can produce in a year all that is necessary to deliver the bread of 10,000 people at their homes during a whole year.</p><p>Thus it would suffice for a man to work under the same conditions for <em>30 hours, say 6 half-days of five hours each, to have bread for a whole year</em>; and to work 30 half-days to guarantee the same to a family of 5 people.</p></div> </div>
