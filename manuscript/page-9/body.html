He became the intellectual leader of Anarchist-Communism; took part in the labor movement; wrote many books and pamphlets; established <em>Le Révolté</em> in Geneva and <em>Freedom</em> in London; contributed to the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>; was twice imprisoned because of his radical activities; and twice visited America. After the Bolshevist revolution he returned to Russia, kept himself apart from Soviet activities, and died true to his ideals.</p></div> </div>
