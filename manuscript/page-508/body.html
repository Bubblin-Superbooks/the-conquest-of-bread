<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>M. Ponce, And Especially His Workmen, Work Like Niggers. It Takes Eight Men To Cultivate A Plot A Little Less Than Three Acres (2.7). They Work Twelve And Even Fifteen Hours A Day, That Is To Say, Three Times More Than Is Needed. Twenty-four Of Them Would Not Be Too Many. To Which M. Ponce Will Probably Answer That As He Pays The Terrible Sum Of £100 Rent A Year For His 2.7 Acres Of Land, And £100 For Manure Bought In The Barracks, He Is Obliged To Exploit. He Would No Doubt Answer, "Being Exploited, I Exploit In My Turn." His Installation Has Also Cost Him £1,200, Of Which Certainly More Than Half Went As Tribute To The Idle Barons Of Industry. In Reality, This Establishment Represents At Most 3,000 Work-days, Probably Much Less.</h4></div> </div>
