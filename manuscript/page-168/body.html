But say at the same gathering, preach at the street  corners and in the market places, that the most tempting delicacies ought to be kept for the sick and feebleâ€”especially for the sick. Say that if there are only five brace of partridge in the entire city, and only one case of sherry, they should go to sick people and convalescents. Say that after the sick come the children. For them the milk of the cows and goats should be reserved if there is not enough for all.
