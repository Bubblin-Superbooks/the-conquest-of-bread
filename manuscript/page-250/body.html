<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Suppose that in this society all children learn to work with their hands as well as with their brains. Admit that all adults, save women, engaged in the  education of their children, bind themselves to work <em>5 hours a day</em> from the age of twenty or twenty-two to forty-five or fifty, and that they follow occupations they have chosen themselves in any one of those branches of human work which in this city are considered <em>necessary</em>. Such a society could in return guarantee well-being to all its members, a well-being more substantial than that enjoyed to-day by the middle classes. And, moreover, each worker belonging to this society would have at his disposal at least 5 hours a day which he could devote to science, art, and individual needs which do not come under the category of <em>necessities</em>, but will probably do so later on, when man's productivity will have augmented, and those objects will no longer appear luxurious or inaccessible.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
